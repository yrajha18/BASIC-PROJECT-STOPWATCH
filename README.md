# SIMPLE-STOPWATCH
<br>
#My first web development project is a stopwatch application built using the following tech stack:

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the applicationâ€™s interface.
- **CSS**: Handles the styling, creating a visually appealing layout.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the functionality, enabling real-time stopwatch operations like start, stop, and reset.

This project demonstrates my ability to combine these technologies to create an interactive, fully functional application.
