# SIMPLE-STOPWATCH
<br>
#My first web development project is a stopwatch application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases the seamless integration of these technologies to create an interactive, fully functional stopwatch. It includes features such as start, stop, and reset buttons, with precise time tracking. This project demonstrates my foundational skills in front-end development.
